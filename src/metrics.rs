//! # Performance Metrics Collection Module
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive performance measurement capabilities for the
//! IPC benchmark suite. It implements high-precision latency measurement using
//! HDR (High Dynamic Range) histograms and detailed throughput analysis.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **HDR Histogram Integration**: Uses HdrHistogram for accurate latency measurement
//!   without coordination omission (the problem where measurements affect results)
//! - **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive percentile analysis and distribution metrics
//! - **Multi-Worker Aggregation**: Proper statistical combination of results from concurrent workers
//! - **Dual Measurement**: Simultaneous latency and throughput measurement
//! - **Flexible Collection**: Support for both one-way and round-trip latency patterns
//!
//! ## HDR Histogram Benefits
//!
//! Traditional latency measurement approaches suffer from coordination omission,
//! where the act of measurement itself affects the results. HDR histograms solve
//! this by providing:
//! - Constant-time recording regardless of value
//! - Configurable precision control
//! - Efficient memory usage even for wide value ranges
//! - Built-in percentile calculation
//!
//! ## Measurement Types
//!
//! The module supports two primary measurement patterns:
//! - **One-way latency**: Time to transmit a message from sender to receiver
//! - **Round-trip latency**: Time for complete request-response cycle
//!
//! ## Usage Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use ipc_benchmark::metrics::{MetricsCollector, LatencyType};
//! # use std::time::Duration;
//! #
//! # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//! // Create collector for one-way latency measurement
//! let mut collector = MetricsCollector::new(
//!     Some(LatencyType::OneWay),
//!     vec![50.0, 95.0, 99.0, 99.9]
//! )?;
//!
//! // Record a message with latency
//! collector.record_message(1024, Some(Duration::from_micros(100)))?;
//!
//! // Get comprehensive metrics
//! let metrics = collector.get_metrics();
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```

///
/// ## Measurement Patterns
///
/// - **OneWay**: Measures transmission latency from send to receive
/// - **RoundTrip**: Measures complete request-response cycle time
///
/// The distinction is important because round-trip measurements include
/// processing time on the receiver side, while one-way measurements
/// focus purely on transmission characteristics.

///
/// This structure provides a complete statistical analysis of latency measurements

///
/// ## Statistical Measures
///
/// - **Basic Statistics**: Min, max, mean, median, standard deviation
/// - **Percentile Analysis**: User-configurable percentiles (P95, P99, etc.)
/// - **Distribution Data**: Raw histogram data for advanced analysis
/// - **Sample Count**: Total number of measurements collected
///
/// ## Percentile Interpretation
///
/// Percentiles provide insights into latency distribution:
/// - P50 (median): Half of all requests complete faster than this
/// - P95: 95% of requests complete faster than this (captures most users)
/// - P99: 99% of requests complete faster than this (captures outliers)
/// - P99.9: 99.9% of requests complete faster than this (captures worst case)
